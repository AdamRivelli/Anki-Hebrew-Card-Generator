# hebrew-to-anki

An addon that helps to automatically create English - Hebrew flashcards for Anki using data from [Pealim](https://www.pealim.com/).

# Usage:
Generates cards that match the format from [this shared deck](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1332710792), so you should be using the note type from that deck.

To generate a card, lookup the word on [Pealim](https://www.pealim.com/), copy and paste the link (like `https://www.pealim.com/dict/7-lalechet/`) into the `Hebrew` field in the note, and click the `פע` button.

Ensure that the link isn't formatted when you paste it into the `Hebrew` text box.
